      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Anthropology being the study of human 
        behavior and society in the past and presents often 
        reflects on other spices practices to predetermine how th
        e human society act. In the reading "Animal Models and Gender,
        " we saw how multiple animals interact, we saw the difference in behavioral interactions between 
        the role of male and female in each animals coexistence. 
        In this coexistence, the males are generally the dominant genders.
         Females are expected to care for the babies and comply with the norms
          of mating, whereas males would be the one who hunts and polygamist. 
           Another trade that the reading illustrated is that behavior depends 
           on the environment if we considered the experiment conducted 
           with The group of macaques to determine whether maternal instinct 
           and mother love. The reason we read this article titled "Animal 
           Models and Gender"  for the class is that many can argue males are 
           naturally the dominant species. By looking at the animals behavioral,
            they can justify sexism. By reading this article, we can understand 
            how society portrays and interprets women vs. men.
